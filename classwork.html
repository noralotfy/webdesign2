<h3> An example of a static website is
  <a href="https://noralotfy.github.io/webdesign2/exp/index.html"> this website. </a>
It is a static website because it only uses html and css. It also doesn't use
any data bases and only updates when the admin updates it. I like this example because of the aesthetics/layout and the amination when the user scrolls.</h3>
<h3> An example of a Dynamic website is
  <a href="https://twitter.com/Valkyrae?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"> twitter. </a>
Twitter is dynamic because it uses databases and constantly updates from the user posting tweets. I like this website because it is constantly changing so there is always something new to read or see.</h3>
